          Pop culture used to define a generation, but it seems the cultural,
          music and fashion trends of the 1990s have been recycled, and what
          Generation X considered its rite of passage into adulthood, is being
          discovered and claimed by fledgling grown-ups as their own."

        <div className="blog-post-text">
          There's been the resurgence of vinyl as the trend-setters' choice of
          music consumption rather than the ease of a digital download, and now
          the hipsters have discovered the nostalgic sound of a whirring
          cassette from which to enjoy the dulcet tones of everyone from
          Salt-N-Pepa to Rick Astley.
