          Why are we so nostalgic for the 1990s? Pop culture used to define a
          generation, but it seems the cultural, music and fashion trends of the
          1990s have been recycled, and what Generation X considered its rite of
          passage into adulthood, is being discovered and claimed by fledgling
          grown-ups as their own. There's been the resurgence of vinyl as the
          trend-setters' choice of music consumption rather than the ease of a
          digital download, and now the hipsters have discovered the nostalgic
          sound of a whirring cassette from which to enjoy the dulcet tones of
          everyone from Salt-N-Pepa to Rick Astley.

          The death of Queen Elizabeth II on September 8 at the age of 96
          represents a monumental shift for the British monarchy and the people
          of England. Royals have died before, of course, but the Queen ruled
          for more than 70 years, and represented a certain stability and
          decorum that held the institution of the Royal Family together as it
          slowly grew more visibly anachronistic and battered by endless
          scandals.
