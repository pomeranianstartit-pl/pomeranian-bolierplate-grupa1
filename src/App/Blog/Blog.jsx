    <h1>Why are we so nostalgic for the 1990s?</h1>
    <p>
      Pop culture used to define a generation, but it seems the cultural, music
      and fashion trends of the 1990s have been recycled, and what Generation X
      considered its rite of passage into adulthood, is being discovered and
      claimed by fledgling grown-ups as their own. There's been the resurgence
      of vinyl as the trend-setters' choice of music consumption rather than the
      ease of a digital download, and now the hipsters have discovered the
      nostalgic sound of a whirring cassette from which to enjoy the dulcet
      tones of everyone from Salt-N-Pepa to Rick Astley.
